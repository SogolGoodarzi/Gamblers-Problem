# Gamblers-Problem
The Example 4.3. from Sutton's book. A gambler has the opportunity to make bets on the outcomes of a sequence of coin flips. If the coin comes up heads, he wins as many dollars as he has staked on that flip; if it is tails, he loses his stake. The game ends when the gambler wins by reaching his goal of $100, or loses by running out of money.
